                    footballer who plays as a forward. He plays for Premier League club Manchester United and is the

                    He was non-stop that season. He scored a number of 61 goals that season. Isn't it hilarious? Most
                    probably the best season of his career. He proved himself as the real G.O.A.T.

                Rumours said Ronaldo just stands in the panalty area and wait for balls to come and then he scores for
                him,
                he doesn't play for his team. But! he proved them wrong. He scored by himself,and made his temamates
                scored.
                Overall, 21 assists got into his pocket.

                <p> Approaximately appeared in 54 games. Yet he always proved himself. He proved that he is strong
                    enough to
                    play more and more. As the world can see, He still plays his games at Manchester United at the age
                    of 36
                    years. Very few players managed to that. He proved that he is the living legend.</p>

                He is super strong. I am not sure if he will play until 40 though or beyond that. Soccer unlike American
                football requires so much running and endurance. Injuries can happen and just exhaustion from years of
                playing. He may decide he has had enough before 40 and try to switch to coaching.
